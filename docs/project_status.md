# PACS System Project Status

## Overview

The PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) project has successfully implemented the core DICOM services required for a complete medical imaging system. This document summarizes the current status and future development plans.

## Implemented Features

- **Storage Service**: Complete implementation of DICOM Storage SCP/SCU
- **Worklist Service**: Implementation of Modality Worklist SCP/SCU
- **Query/Retrieve Service**: Implementation of DICOM Query/Retrieve SCP/SCU
- **MPPS Service**: Implementation of Modality Performed Procedure Step SCP/SCU
- **Sample Applications**: Complete set of example applications demonstrating each service
- **Integrated Samples**: Fully functional PACS server and client demonstrating complete workflows

## Technical Achievements

- Modular architecture allowing flexible deployment configurations
- Thread management for concurrent operations
- Robust error handling and reporting
- Support for various DICOM SOP Classes
- C++20 standard compliance
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Next Development Phase

The next phase of development will focus on:

1. Performance optimization for high-volume environments
2. Extended SOP Class support for advanced modalities
3. Integration with database systems for persistent storage
4. Web-based viewing capabilities
5. Security enhancements (TLS, authentication, authorization)
6. Containerization for easy deployment

## Timeline

The projected timeline for the next phase includes:

- June 2025: Performance optimization and testing
- July 2025: Database integration and persistence
- August 2025: Web viewer implementation
- September 2025: Security enhancements
- October 2025: Containerization and deployment tools
- November 2025: Beta testing and refinement
- December 2025: Release of version 1.0

## Conclusion

The PACS System project has established a solid foundation with all core DICOM services implemented and demonstrated through sample applications. The project is now ready to move forward with advanced features for a complete production-ready system.
