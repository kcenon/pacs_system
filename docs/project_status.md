# PACS System Project Status

## Overview

The PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) project has successfully implemented the core DICOM services required for a complete medical imaging system. This document summarizes the current status and recent improvements.

## Implemented Features

- **Storage Service**: Complete implementation of DICOM Storage SCP/SCU
- **Worklist Service**: Implementation of Modality Worklist SCP/SCU
- **Query/Retrieve Service**: Implementation of DICOM Query/Retrieve SCP/SCU
- **MPPS Service**: Implementation of Modality Performed Procedure Step SCP/SCU
- **Service Interfaces**: Comprehensive interfaces for all DICOM services
- **Thread System**: Direct integration with thread_system submodule
- **Result Pattern**: Consistent error handling throughout the codebase
- **Sample Applications**: Example applications demonstrating each service

## Recent Improvements

The project has undergone several important improvements:

1. **Thread System Optimization**:
   - Removed redundant thread_manager and thread_pool implementations
   - Integrated directly with thread_system submodule
   - Simplified thread management across components
   - Reduced code duplication and overhead

2. **Service Interface Implementation**:
   - Added comprehensive service_interface.h defining base interfaces
   - Created specialized interfaces for different service types
   - Standardized service lifecycle management

3. **Build System Enhancements**:
   - Reduced duplicate library warnings
   - Optimized dependency structure
   - Improved CMake configuration for better modularity
   - Streamlined linking between components

4. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed empty and unnecessary files
   - Eliminated placeholder implementations
   - Improved directory structure
   - Enhanced code organization

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated architecture documentation
   - Revised project structure descriptions
   - Clarified threading model

## Technical Achievements

- Modular architecture allowing flexible deployment configurations
- Concurrent operation handling with thread pools
- Robust error handling with Result pattern
- Support for various DICOM SOP Classes
- C++20 standard compliance
- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Next Development Phase

The next phase of development will focus on:

1. **Simplified DICOM API**:
   - Creating a more intuitive DICOM interface
   - Implementing higher-level abstractions
   - Reducing DCMTK-specific knowledge requirements

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Fine-tuning thread pools for specific workloads
   - Optimizing memory usage in DICOM operations
   - Improving overall system throughput

3. **Extended Features**:
   - Database integration for persistent storage
   - Web-based viewing capabilities
   - Additional DICOM service classes

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - TLS implementation for network communications
   - Authentication and authorization systems
   - Audit logging for security events

5. **Deployment Tools**:
   - Containerization support
   - Configuration management
   - Monitoring and diagnostics

## Timeline

The projected timeline for the next phase includes:

- June 2025: Simplified DICOM API and performance optimization
- July 2025: Database integration and persistence
- August 2025: Web viewer implementation
- September 2025: Security enhancements
- October 2025: Containerization and deployment tools
- November 2025: Beta testing and refinement
- December 2025: Release of version 1.0

## Conclusion

The PACS System project is progressing well with all core DICOM services implemented and recent improvements enhancing the architecture. The direct integration with the thread_system has simplified the codebase while maintaining performance. With the comprehensive service interfaces now in place, the project has established a solid foundation for future enhancements.
