## Executive Summary

### Product Name
PACS System (Picture Archiving and Communication System)

### Product Description
A production-ready C++20 PACS implementation built entirely on the kcenon ecosystem without external DICOM libraries. This system implements the DICOM standard from scratch, providing complete control over the codebase while leveraging high-performance infrastructure from existing ecosystem components.

### Key Differentiators
- **Zero External DICOM Dependencies**: Pure implementation using kcenon ecosystem
- **High Performance**: SIMD acceleration, lock-free queues, async I/O
- **Full Ecosystem Integration**: Native integration with 6 existing systems
- **Production Grade**: Comprehensive CI/CD, sanitizers, quality metrics
